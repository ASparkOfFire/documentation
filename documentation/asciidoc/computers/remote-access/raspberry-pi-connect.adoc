== Screen share with Raspberry Pi Connect

You can access the desktop of a Raspberry Pi remotely from another device using Raspberry Pi Connect. Raspberry Pi Connect shares your screen in a browser window and handles configuration for you, so you don't have to find your Raspberry Pi's local IP address or modify your local network.

For more information, see xref:../services/connect.adoc[the Connect documentation].
