The CSI and DSI ports found on previous models of Rasbpberry Pi have been combined into two multi-purpose CSI/DSI (MIPI) ports. To fit onto the board these now using the denser connector pinout prevously only found on Raspberry Pi Zero and the CM4IO board. You can connect either two displays, or two cameras (or one camera and one display) to these ports.

There is no configuration necessary for Raspberry Pi devices like xref:../accessories/camera.adoc[cameras]. If you plug in a camera or display into either MIPI connector you will get an appropriate CSI or DSI connection, and your device will be made available to the OS.

NOTE: The Compute Module cable adaptors, see https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/cmcda/cmcda-schematics.pdf[schematics] and https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/cmcda/RPi-CMCDA-1P1.zip[design files], can be used to connect standard cables to the higher density "mini" connectors.

=== Available camera cables

There are three Flat Flexible Cable (FFC) available to connect CSI cameras to the Raspberry Pi 5:

* 200 mm camera cable Standard to Mini
* 300 mm camera cable Standard to Mini
* 500 mm camera cable Standard to Mini

=== Available display cables

There are three Flat Flexible Cable (FFC) available to connect DSI displays to the Raspberry Pi 5:

* 200 mm display cable Standard to Mini
* 300 mm display cable Standard to Mini
* 500 mm display cable Standard to Mini

=== Using non-Raspberry Pi devices

If you are using a non-Raspberry Pi MIPI device with the Raspberry Pi 5 it will not be automatically configured. Instead you will need to add a `dtoverlay` setting into the `/boot/firmware/config.txt` file to correctly configure the right port for the right camera or display.

These `dtoverlay` settings should be provided by the manufactuer of your device, but for example, adding `dtoverlay=ov9281` would add an Omnivision OV9281-based camera to CSI/DSI1, while adding `dtoverlay=ov9281,cam0` would add the same camera to CSI/DSI0.
