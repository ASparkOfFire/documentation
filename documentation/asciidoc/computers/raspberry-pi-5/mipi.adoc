== MIPI CSI/DSI connectors

The CSI and DSI ports found on previous models of Rasbpberry Pi have been combined into two multi-purpose CSI/DSI ports. To fit onto the board these now using the denser connector pinout prevously only found on Raspberry Pi Zero. You can connect either two displays, or two cameras (or one camera and one display) to these ports.

NOTE: The Compute Module cable adaptors, see https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/cmcda/cmcda-schematics.pdf[schematics] and https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/cmcda/RPi-CMCDA-1P1.zip[design files], can be used.
