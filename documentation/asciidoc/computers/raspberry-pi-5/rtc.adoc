== Real Time Clock (RTC)

The Raspberry Pi 5 includes an RTC module. This may be battery powered, via the J5 (BAT) connector on the board located to the right of the USB-C power connector. However, even without a battery backup the RTC is useable

You can set a wake alarm while will switch the board to a very low power state (approximately 3mA). When alarm time is reached, the board will power back on. You could imagine using this for periodic jobs, e.g. time lapse imagery.

To support the low powered mode for wake up alarms you should edit the bootloader config,

[source,bash]
----
sudo -E rpi-eeprom-config --edit
----

adding the following two lines.

[source, bash]
----
POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=1
WAKE_ON_GPIO=0
----

You can test the functionality with with:

[source,bash]
----
echo +600 | sudo tee /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm
sudo halt
----

That will halt the board into a very low power state, then wake and restart after 10 minutes.

The RTC also provides the time on boot. e.g. in `dmesg`:

[source,bash]
----
[    1.295799] rpi-rtc soc:rpi_rtc: setting system clock to 2023-08-16T15:58:50 UTC (1692201530)
----

which may be useful if you don't have an internet connection for getting time through NTP.

[NOTE]
====
The current bootloader doesn't enable the RTC XOSC, until an update is released you can manually do this:

[source, bash]
----
vcgencmd pmicwr 0x5003 1
----

This setting is persistent, so you should only have to do this once.

=== Adding a backup battery

WARNING: We do not recommend using a primary Lithium cell for the RTC as it has a trickle charge circuit which, while disabled by default, if enabled will kill the cell quite quickly.

The official battery part is a rechargeable Lithium Manganese coin cell, with a pre-fitted two-pin JST plug and adhesive mounting pad. This is suitable for powering the Raspberry Pi 5 RTC when the main power supply for the board is disconnected with a power-off current draw is single-digit ÂµA, giving a retention retention time measured in months.
