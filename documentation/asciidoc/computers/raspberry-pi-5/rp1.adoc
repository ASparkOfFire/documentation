The RP1 is a 12 × 12mm, 0.65mm-pitch BGA, “southbridge” which provides the majority of the I/O capabilities for Raspberry Pi 5. Access to peripherals from BCM2712 is done via the RP1 on Raspberry Pi 5. It provides:

* 4-lane PCIe 2.0 endpoint
* Gigabit Ethernet MAC
* (connection to external PHY using RGMII) 
** 2 × USB 3 host controllers
** Each has 1 × USB 3 and 1 × USB 2 port
* More than double usable USB BW vs Pi 4
* 2 × SDIO ports / eMMC (not used on Pi 5)
* MIPI transceivers (4-lane, supporting DSI and CSI-2)
** Video DAC (3-channel, supporting PAL/NTSC and VGA)
* Only one channel (composite) used on Pi 5
* Low-speed peripherals (SPI, UART, I2C, PWM, GPIO, I2S)
* Delta Sigma PWM audio out
