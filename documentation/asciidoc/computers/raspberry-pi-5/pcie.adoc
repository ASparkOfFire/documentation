== Raspberry Pi connector for PCIe


=== Enabling PCIe

By default mthe PCIe header is not enabled To enable it you can add the following options into `/boot/firmware/config.txt` and reboot:

[source]
----
# Enable the PCIe External connector.
dtparam=pciex1
----

NOTE: A more memorable alias for `pciex1` exists, so you can alternatively add `dtparam=nvme` to the `/boot/firmware/config.txt` file.

The connection is certified for Gen 2.0 speeds (5 GT/sec), but you can force it to Gen 3.0 (10 GT/sec) if you add the following lines

[source]
----
# Enable the PCIe External connector.
dtparam=pciex1

# Force Gen 3.0 speeds
dtparam=pciex1_gen=3
----

WARNING: The Raspberry Pi 5 is not certified for Gen 3.0 speeds, and connections to PCIe devices at these speeds may be unstable.
