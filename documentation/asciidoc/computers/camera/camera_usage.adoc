This documentation describes how use supported camera modules with our software tools. All Raspberry Pi cameras can record high-resolution photographs and full HD 1080p video (or better) with our software tools.

Raspberry Pi produces several official camera modules, including the original 5-megapixel Camera Module 1, the 8-megapixel https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-v2/[Camera Module 2], and the 12-megapixel https://raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-3/[Camera Module 3]. The Camera Module 3 also comes in a wide field-of-view model. We produce infrared versions of each, except for the Camera Module 1, which has been discontinued.

Additionally, we make a 12-megapixel https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/[High Quality Camera] with CS- or M12-mount variants for use with external lenses. There is no infrared version of the HQ Camera.

For more information about camera hardware, see the xref:../accessories/camera.adoc#about-the-camera-modules[camera hardware documentation].
