== Getting started

Depending on your setup, there are several ways to wire the Debug Probe to a xref:raspberry-pi-pico.adoc[Raspberry Pi Pico]. Below, we connect the Debug Probe to a Raspberry Pi Pico H which has the newer three-pin JST connector for SWD.

Here we have connected:

* The Debug Probe "D" connector to Pico H SWD JST connector
* The Debug Probe "U" connector has the three-pin JST connector to 0.1-inch header 
** Debug Probe RX connected to Pico H TX pin
** Debug Probe TX connected to Pico H RX pin
** Debug Probe GND connected to Pico H GND pin

Note: If you have a non-H version of Raspberry Pi Pico or Pico W with a 3-pin SWD connector, you can still connect it to a Debug Probe. To do so, connect the SWDCLK, SWDIO, GND, and 3V3 pins on the Pico board to the corresponding pins on the Debug Probe using jumper wires. Then, use your preferred debugging and programming tools to work with the Pico board.
