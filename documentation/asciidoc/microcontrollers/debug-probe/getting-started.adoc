Depending on your setup, there are several ways to wire the Debug Probe to a xref:raspberry-pi-pico.adoc[Raspberry Pi Pico]. Below, we connect the Debug Probe to a Raspberry Pi Pico H which has the newer three-pin JST-SH connector for SWD.

Connect the following:

* The Debug Probe "D" port to Pico H SWD JST-SH connector
* The Debug Probe "U" port, with the three-pin JST-SH connector to 0.1-inch header (male):
** Debug Probe `RX` connected to Pico H `TX` pin
** Debug Probe `TX` connected to Pico H `RX` pin
** Debug Probe `GND` connected to Pico H `GND` pin

NOTE: If you have an "original" Raspberry Pi Pico or Pico W (without a JST-SH connector) you can still connect it to a Debug Probe. To do so, solder a male connector to the `SWCLK`, `SWDIO` and `GND` header pins on the board, and connect them to the Debug Probe "D" port using the alternate 3-pin JST-SH connector to 0.1-inch header (female) cable included with the Debug Probe.
