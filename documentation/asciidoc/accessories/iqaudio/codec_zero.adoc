=== Raspberry Pi Codec Zero

Raspberry Pi Codec Zero is a Raspberry Pi Zero sized audio HAT. It delivers bi-directional digital audio signals (I2S) between Raspberry Pi and its onboard Dialog Semiconductor DA7212 codec. The Codec Zero has multiple features and supports a range of input and output devices:

* High performance 24-bit audio codec
* Supports common audio sample rates between 8-96kHz
* Built in MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical) microphone (Mic2)
* Mono Electret microphone (Mic2 left)
* Automatic MEMS disabling on Mic2 insert detect
* Supports additional (no fit) Mono Electret microphone (Mic1 right)
* Stereo auxiliary input channel (AUX IN) - PHONO/RCA connectors
* Stereo auxiliary output channel (Headphone / AUX OUT)
* Flexible analog and digital mixing paths
* DSP (Digital Signal Processors) for ALC (Automatic Level Control)
* 5-band EQ (Equalisation)
* Mono line-out / mini speaker driver: 1.2W @ 5V, THD<10%, R=8Ω

The Codec Zero includes an EEPROM which can be used for auto-configuration of the Linux environment if necessary.

The unit has an integrated MEMS microphone, can be used with stereo microphone input via 3.5mm socket and a mono speaker (1.2W / 8Ω).

In addition to the green (GPIO23) and red (GPIO24) LEDs, a tactile programmable button (GPIO27) is also provided.
