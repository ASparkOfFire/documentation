=== Raspberry Pi DAC Pro

Raspberry Pi DAC Pro is our highest-fidelity DAC (Digital to Analogue Converter) HAT for all generations of Raspberry Pi.

The DAC Pro uses the Texas Instruments PCM5242 to deliver outstanding Signal to Noise Ration
and supports Balanced / Differential out in parallel to Phono / RCA line level output. It also includes a
dedicated headphone amplifier. The DAC Pro is powered by Raspberry Pi through the GPIO header.

Component selection and track layout have been in the forefront of our design to ensure noise
immunity and best possible audio playback with the DAC Pro.

The DAC Pro exposes two 3 pin headers (P7/P9) used by the optional XLR board to provide
Differential / Balanced output exposed by XLR sockets above the Raspberry Piâ€™s USB/Ethernet ports.

| *P1* | Analogue out (0..2V RMS), carries GPIO27, MUTE signal (headphone detect), Left and Right
Audio and Left and Right Ground.
| *P6* | Headphone socket signals (pin1: LEFT, 2:GROUND, 3: RIGHT, 4:GROUND, 5:DETECT).
| *P7/9* | Differential (0..4V RMS) output (P7:LEFT, P9: RIGHT).
| *P10* | Alternative 5V input, powering Raspberry Pi in parallel.
