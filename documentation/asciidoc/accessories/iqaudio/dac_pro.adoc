=== Raspberry Pi DAC Pro

Our Raspberry Pi DAC Pro HAT is our highest-fidelity DAC (Digital to Analogue Converter).

With the Texas Instruments PCM5242, the DAC Pro provides outstanding Signal to Noise Ratio
and supports Balanced/Differential out in parallel to Phono/RCA line level output. It also includes a
dedicated headphone amplifier. The DAC Pro is powered by Raspberry Pi through the GPIO header.

A careful selection of components and the layout of tracks have been at the forefront of our design in order to ensure noise immunity and the best playback of audio.

As part of the DAC Pro, two 3 pin headers (P7/P9) are exposed above the Raspberry Pi's USB and Ethernet ports for use by the optional XLR board that allows differential/balanced output.
