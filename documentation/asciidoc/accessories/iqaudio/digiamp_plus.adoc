without any additional soldering.

DigiAMP{plus}’s barrel connector is 5.5mmx2.5mm. DigiAMP{plus} has been designed to provide
power to the Raspberry Pi and DigiAMP{plus} combination in parallel, delivering 5.1v at 2.5Amp to the Pi.

The amplifier is by default muted at power on (mute LED lit). The mute state / LED is under software
control (Raspberry Pi GPIO22).
