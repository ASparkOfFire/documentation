=== Raspberry Pi DigiAMP{plus}

With Raspberry Pi DigiAMP{plus}, you can connect passive stereo speakers up to 2x35W with variable output, making it ideal for use with Raspberry Pi based Hi-Fi systems.

DigiAMP{plus} uses the Texas Instruments TAS5756M PowerDAC and must be powered from an external supply. It requires a 12-24V DC power source (XP Power VEC65US19 power supply is recommended).

DigiAMP{plus}’s barrel connector is 5.5mm x 2.5mm. 

At power-on, the amplifier is muted by default (the mute LED is illuminated). Software is responsible for the mute state and LED control (Raspberry Pi GPIO22).

DigiAMP{plus} is designed to provide power to the Raspberry Pi and DigiAMP{plus} together in parallel, delivering 5.1V at 2.5Amp to the Raspberry Pi through the GPIO header.

WARNING: DO NOT APPLY POWER TO THE RASPBERRY PI’s OWN POWER INPUT WHEN USING DIGIAMP{plus}.
