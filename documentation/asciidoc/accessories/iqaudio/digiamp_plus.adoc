=== Raspberry Pi DigiAMP{plus}

Raspberry Pi DigiAMP{plus} allows direct connection to passive stereo speakers up to 2x35W with variable output making it ideal for a Raspberry Pi based Hi-Fi system.

DigiAMP{plus} uses the Texas Instruments TAS5756M PowerDAC and must be powered from an external supply, it requires a 12-24V DC power source (XP Power VEC65US19 power supply is recommended).

DigiAMP{plus}’s barrel connector is 5.5mm x 2.5mm. 

The amplifier is by default muted at power on (mute LED lit). The mute state / LED is under software
control (Raspberry Pi GPIO22).

DigiAMP{plus} has been designed to provide power to the Raspberry Pi and DigiAMP{plus} together in parallel, delivering 5.1V at 2.5Amp to the Raspberry Pi through the GPIO header.

WARNING: DO NOT APPLY POWER TO THE RASPBERRY PI’s OWN POWER INPUT WHEN USING DIGIAMP{plus}.
