== Raspberry Pi Touch Display

The https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/[Raspberry Pi Touch Display] is an LCD display which connects to the Raspberry Pi through the DSI connector. If your Raspberry Pi has both connectors, you can use the micro HDMI and LCD display outputs at the same time.

Make sure your Raspberry Pi OS is up-to-date before you begin working with the Touch Display to reduce the risk of errors or driver issues.

=== Board Support

The DSI display is designed to work with all models of Raspberry Pi, however early models without mounting holes (the Raspberry Pi 1 Model A and B) will require additional mounting hardware to fit the HAT-sized stand-offs on the display PCB.

=== Connecting a Raspberry Pi

The following image shows how to attach a Raspberry Pi directly to the back of the Touch Display using its standoffs. It also shows the connections you need to make between Raspberry Pi and the display's PCB. You can also mount the touch display in a separate chassis if you have one available. The connections will remain the same, though you may need longer cables depending on the chassis you use.

==== Connecting the display cable

Connect one end of the ribbon cable to the `RPI-DISPLAY` port on the Touch Display PCB so the side with the blue stripe faces the display.

// Close-up image here?

Then connect the other end of the ribbon cable to the `DISPLAY` port on the Raspberry Pi. The blue stripe should face away from the Raspberry Pi.

If the ribbon cable isn't fully inserted, or it's not positioned correctly, you will experience issues with the display. You should always double-check this connection when troubleshooting, especially if you don't see anything on your display, or the display is showing a single color.

==== Powering the Touch Display

There are two options available to provide power to the Touch Display: using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO, or a separate power supply and micro USB cable. 

===== Provide power with Raspberry Pi

To power the Touch Display using a Raspberry Pi, you need to connect two jumper wires between the xref::/../../computers/raspberry-pi.adoc#gpio-and-the-40-pin-header[Raspberry Pi's GPIO] and the GPIO pins on the display's PCB.

.Connect the red and black wires to 5V and GND

Before you begin, make sure the Raspberry Pi is powered off and not connected to any power source.Connect one end of the black jumper wire to pin six (GND) on the Raspberry Pi and one end of the red jumper wire to pin four (5V).

Next, connect the other end of the black wire to the GND pin on the display and the other end of the red wire to the 5V pin on the display.

The other three pins on the Touch Display are used to connect the display to an original Raspberry Pi 1 Model A or B. Refer to our documentation on xref:display.adoc#legacy-support[legacy support] for more information.

NOTE: An original Raspberry Pi is easily identified compared to other models; it is the only model with a 26-pin rather than 40-pin GPIO header connector.

===== Provide power through micro USB

If you don't want to use a Raspberry Pi to provide power to the Touch Display, you can use a micro USB power supply instead. We recommend using the https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/micro-usb-power-supply/[Raspberry Pi 12.5W power supply] to make sure the display runs as intended.

Do not connect the GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi to the display if you choose to use micro USB for power. The only connection between the two boards should be the ribbon cable.

WARNING: If you use a micro USB cable to power the display it must be mounted inside a chassis to reduce the risk of electrocution. The chassis also must block access to the display's PCB while its in use.

=== Screen Orientation

LCD displays have an ideal viewing angle, and it may be necessary to change the orientation of the display to find the perfect angle. If you need to physically rotate the display, or mount it in a specific position, you can use software to adjust the orientation of the screen to better match your setup.

To set the screen orientation from the desktop environment, select the **Screen Configuration** option from the **Preferences** menu. Right click on the DSI display rectangle in the layout editor, select **Orientation**, then pick the best option to fit your needs.

To set screen orientation on a headless setup, or while in console mode, you need to edit the kernel's `cmdline.txt` file to pass the required orientation to the system.

[,bash]
----
sudo nano /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
----

To rotate the screen, add the following to the cmdline. Make sure everything is on the same line; do not add any carriage returns. Possible rotation values are 0, 90, 180 and 270.

----
video=DSI-1:800x480@60,rotate=90
----

NOTE: In console mode it is not possible to rotate the DSI display separately from the HDMI display. If you have both attached they need to be set to the same rotation value.

=== Touchscreen Orientation

You also have the option to change the rotation of the active touchscreen area independently of the display itself by adding a `dtoverlay` instruction in `config.txt`, as in the following example:

`dtoverlay=rpi-ft5406,touchscreen-swapped-x-y=1,touchscreen-inverted-x=1`

The options for the touchscreen are:

|===
| DT parameter | Action

| touchscreen-size-x
| Sets X resolution (default 800)

| touchscreen-size-y
| Sets Y resolution (default 600)

| touchscreen-inverted-x
| Invert X coordinates

| touchscreen-inverted-y
| Invert Y coordinates

| touchscreen-swapped-x-y
| Swap X and Y coordinates
|===

=== X11-only features

If you're using X11 on your Raspberry Pi, you can access an on-screen keyboard and set up virtual right clicks on the Touch Display.

==== On-screen keyboard

To install a virtual keyboard, run `sudo apt install matchbox-keyboard` in the terminal.

==== Emulate right click

You can emulate a right click on the Touch Display by adding this code to `/etc/X11/xorg.conf`:
----
Section "InputClass"
   Identifier "calibration"
   Driver "evdev"
   MatchProduct "FT5406 memory based driver"

   Option "EmulateThirdButton" "1"
   Option "EmulateThirdButtonTimeout" "750"
   Option "EmulateThirdButtonMoveThreshold" "30"
