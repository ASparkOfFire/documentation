== Raspberry Pi Touch Display

The https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/[Raspberry Pi Touch Display] is an LCD display which connects to the Raspberry Pi through the DSI connector. While the panel is connected, you can use both it, and the the normal HDMI display output at the same time.

The Touch Display will function with all models of Raspberry Pi. Although, the earliest Raspberry Pi models, which lack appropriate mounting holes, require additional mounting hardware to fit the stand-offs on the display PCB.

You can mount a Raspberry Pi to the back of the Touch Display using its stand-offs and then connect the appropriate cables between each device, depending on your use case. You can also mount the Touch Display in a separate chassis if you have one available. The connections remain the same, though you may need longer cables depending on the chassis you use.

Connect one end of the ribbon cable to the `RPI-DISPLAY` port on the Touch Display PCB so the side with the silver or gold pins faces away from the display. Then connect the other end of the ribbon cable to the `DISPLAY` port on the Raspberry Pi. The pins should face inward, towards the Raspberry Pi.

If the ribbon cable isn't fully inserted, or it's not positioned correctly, you will experience issues with the display. You should always double-check this connection when troubleshooting, especially if you don't see anything on your display, or the display is showing a single colour.

=== Powering the Touch Display

There are two options available to provide power to the Touch Display: using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO, or a separate micro USB power supply. We recommend using the Raspberry Pi to provide power to the Touch Display whenever possible.

==== Provide power through the Raspberry Pi

To power the Touch Display using a Raspberry Pi, you need to connect two jumper wires between the 5V and GND pins on xref::/../../computers/raspberry-pi.adoc#gpio-and-the-40-pin-header[Raspberry Pi's GPIO] and the 5V and GND pins on the display, as shown in the following illustration.

Before you begin, make sure the Raspberry Pi is powered off and not connected to any power source. Connect one end of the black jumper wire to pin six (GND) on the Raspberry Pi and one end of the red jumper wire to pin four (5V). If pin six isn't available, you can use any other open GND pin to connect the black wire. 

Next, connect the other end of the black wire to the GND pin on the display and the other end of the red wire to the 5V pin on the display. Once all the connections are made, you should see the Touch Display turn on the next time you turn on your Raspberry Pi.

The other three pins on the Touch Display are used to connect the display to an original Raspberry Pi 1 Model A or B. Refer to our documentation on xref:display.adoc#legacy-support[legacy support] for more information.

NOTE: An original Raspberry Pi is easily identified compared to other models; it is the only model with a 26-pin rather than 40-pin GPIO header connector.

==== Power the Touch Display directly

If you don't want to use a Raspberry Pi to provide power to the Touch Display, you can use a micro USB power supply instead. We recommend using the https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/micro-usb-power-supply/[Raspberry Pi 12.5W power supply] to make sure the display runs as intended.

Do not connect the GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi to the display if you choose to use micro USB for power. The only connection between the two boards should be the ribbon cable.

WARNING: If you use a micro USB cable to power the display it must be mounted inside a chassis to reduce the risk of electrocution. The chassis also must block access to the display's PCB while it's in use.

=== Screen Orientation

LCD displays have an ideal viewing angle, and it may be necessary to change the orientation of the display to find the perfect angle. If you need to physically rotate the display, or mount it in a specific position, you can use software to adjust the orientation of the screen to better match your setup.

To set the screen orientation from the desktop environment, select the **Screen Configuration** option from the **Preferences** menu. Right click on the DSI display rectangle in the layout editor, select **Orientation**, then pick the best option to fit your needs.

To set screen orientation while in console mode, you need to edit the kernel's `cmdline.txt` file to pass the required orientation to the system.

[source ,bash]
----
sudo nano /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
----

To rotate the screen, add the following to the cmdline. Make sure everything is on the same line; do not add any carriage returns. Possible rotation values are 0, 90, 180 and 270.

----
video=DSI-1:800x480@60,rotate=90
----

NOTE: In console mode it is not possible to rotate the DSI display separately from the HDMI display. If you have both attached they need to be set to the same rotation value.

=== Touchscreen Orientation

You also have the option to change the rotation of the active touchscreen area independently of the display itself by adding a `dtoverlay` instruction in `config.txt`, as in the following example:

----
dtoverlay=rpi-ft5406,touchscreen-swapped-x-y=1,touchscreen-inverted-x=1
----

The options for the touchscreen are:

|===
| DT parameter | Action

| touchscreen-size-x
| Sets X resolution (default 800)

| touchscreen-size-y
| Sets Y resolution (default 600)

| touchscreen-inverted-x
| Invert X coordinates

| touchscreen-inverted-y
| Invert Y coordinates

| touchscreen-swapped-x-y
| Swap X and Y coordinates
