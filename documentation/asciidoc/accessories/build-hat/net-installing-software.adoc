== Using the Build HAT from .NET 

=== Installing the .NET Framework

The .NET framework from Microsoft is not available via `apt` on Raspberry Pi. However, you can follow the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/iot/deployment[official instructions] from Microsoft to install the .NET framework. Alternatively, there is a simplified https://www.petecodes.co.uk/install-and-use-microsoft-dot-net-5-with-the-raspberry-pi/[third party route] to get the .NET toolchain on to your Raspberry Pi. 

WARNING: The installation script is run as `root`. You should read it first and make sure you understand what it is doing. If you are at all unsure you should follow the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/iot/deployment[official instructions] manually.

[.bash]
----
$ wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjgpetecodes/dotnet5pi/master/install.sh | sudo bash
----

After installing the .NET framework you can create your project:
[.bash]
----
$ dotnet new console --name buildhat
---

This creates a default program in the `buildhat` directory, so we go into that directory and run the program.
It should print `Hello World!`
[.bash]
---
$ cd buildhat
$ dotnet run
Hello World!
---

You will now need to install the following nuget packages:
[.bash]
----
$ dotnet add package System.Device.Gpio --version 2.1.0
$ dotnet add package Iot.Device.Bindings --version 2.1.0
----
